# SUPER BATTLESHIP PARTY

## What Is It

Super Battleship Party is a web-based applciation that let's you play Battleships with an all new twist, creating a deeper, more immersive and wild experience for you and your partner of choice. This project was built in less than 24 hours for the **_Bath Hack 2022_** hackathon.

The basic run-down is this:
- The game starts and you set up your board with your battleships
- You and your opponent take it in turns to try and hit each others ships, nothing new
- However now, when a shot is fired, a random, rapid minigame launches, and whoever loses, now has to suffer the shot

This introduces a whole new meta to the game, where you try not to target squares that your ships could be on (it's too risky), but by doing this you are slowly revealing to your opponent where your ships are. It also creates a far more hetic experience than traditional Battleships, as the minigames require a strong reaction time, quick thinking skills, strategy and more!

Some of the minigames include:
- Blackjack (21)
- Reaction Speedtest
- Simon Says
- Maths Speedround
- and more!

## The Tech Stack

This project was build using:
- TypeScript, a variation of JavaScript with a stronger type-system
- React, a modern, declarative way to build UIs with state, and optimised rendering
- Tailwind, a CSS framework for styling components
- Express.js, Express Web Sockets on Node.js for managing the networking
